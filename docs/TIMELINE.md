# TIMELINE.md — rules for authoring a skill, trigger, buff or debuff

Rules an authored skill, trigger, buff or debuff must satisfy. The simulation's
control flow is `src/engine/timeline.ts` — read it there, not here. Which system
a mechanic belongs in is BUFFS.md; the damage math is CALCULATION.md.

Per-skill behaviour that is genuinely not reconstructable from the module gets a
short comment **in that module**, never a section here (CLAUDE.md § "Docs are
implementation rules").

## Coefficients

A skill is a sequence of hits, each carrying its own damage shape — phys and
attribute multipliers, phys and attribute flat damage — plus its `frame` offset
on the 60 fps grid. Rules:

- Set every coefficient on the hit, put each hit at its real `frame`, and set
  `castFrames` (0 derives it from the last hit).
- `skillType` selects the boost bucket and the sustain branch. Tag a skill
  `sustain` only if it genuinely wants sustain routing.
- `attributeAttack` must name the attribute path that gets the elevated
  multiplier, or be empty.
- `weaponOrAttribute` is the lookup key into the weapon or mystic-category boost
  map. A skill whose key resolves to neither takes no typing boost.
- `elevatedAttributeMultiplier` **defaults true** on every row, DoT ticks
  included. Set it false only when a hit has its own reason to take the
  non-matching coefficient — doing so demotes the row's flat attribute term
  along with its coefficient, never one without the other.
- `neverAbrades` removes the abrasion outcome: the mass that would have abraded
  deals the normal row. Precision, crit and affinity chances are unchanged — a
  hit that fails precision still cannot crit. `guaranteedNormal` means the hit
  can trigger none of crit, affinity or abrasion and always deals the normal
  row.
- **Identifiers are English only** (CLAUDE.md § "Language").

### Hit variants

A hit may carry buff-gated alternative coefficient rows. The first variant whose
conditions all hold replaces the hit's four coefficients; nothing else is
affected, and no match leaves the hit's own row untouched. **This is how an
empowered form is authored** — never with a per-skill branch in the timeline.

A variant may also carry its own cast length, for an empowered form that
genuinely runs longer or shorter than the skill's own. Every cast's length is
resolved incrementally, in rotation order, against the ledger state built from
every cast laid out before it — never only the rotation's declared opening
state — so a condition only a mid-fight trigger satisfies can still activate a
cast-length override. A cast's own triggers can never affect its own length or
hit set; only what came before it can. Where a skill's several hits each
select an active variant with an override, the first hit in authoring order
decides. Leaving the override unset, or giving it the same placeholder value
`castFrames` itself uses for "not yet measured", both mean no override — never
a value that could move the cast cursor backwards.

### Conditional hits

A hit may carry its own ANDed conditions, gating whether it occurs at all —
unmet, it deals no damage and fires no triggers, exactly as if it were absent
from the cast. This resolves at the same point, and against the same ledger
state, as the cast's own length, so a skill whose real hit count only grows
past some threshold is authored as one hit per real hit, each gated on that
threshold, rather than as a separate module per hit count. A cast's length
must be derived only from the hits that actually occur, never from every hit
the skill could ever land.

## Identity and tags

- **Ids are matched, names are not.** A buff reaches or is triggered by a skill
  or debuff through an id it declares — `receives` / `triggersBuffs` — never a
  display name. Namespaced tags still address the few things that read them
  directly: a mechanic's own scope, an attunement's reach, and a guard picking
  between magnitudes under a single reach. Never make a display name
  load-bearing, and never match a tag or an id by prefix.
- Wherever a tag is still the addressing mechanism, matching is **exact
  membership**. Express a family by giving every member the family tag _as
  well as_ its own — never by one name being a stem of another. A skill may
  then belong to several families, which a prefix cannot express.
- **"Every damage-over-time row" is a structural check, not a tag list.** A
  DoT tick's synthetic skill carries `isDotTick`; a mechanic that must reach
  every such row tests that field, never a role tag or an enumerated list of
  them — a list silently stops matching the row it was written for once that
  row is retyped, and never grows to cover one added later.
- **The breakdown row a cast reports into is authored, not derived.** A skill's
  `breakdownName` is the in-game name its casts are summed under, so the
  engine-level variants of one in-game skill read as a single row; absent or
  blank falls back to the skill's own `name`. It is display text only — nothing
  matches on it, and it changes neither damage nor a cast's own timeline row.
- **Only a hit that deals damage reports into the breakdown.** A hit whose
  coefficients and flat adds are all zero exists to carry triggers; it still
  fires them and still lands on the cast timeline, but it adds neither a count
  nor a row, so a grant-only cast has no breakdown row at all.
- **A pre-pull cast sets up; it never lands.** Its hits fire their `triggers`
  and the cast fires its `triggersBuffs`, and it sits on the cast timeline at
  negative frames — but it adds nothing to the total, the breakdown or an echo
  bank, whatever its coefficients say, and its frames stay out of the duration.
- **A rotation step performs every hit its skill has.** A step names a skill and
  nothing else; a cast cut short is authored as its own skill carrying only the
  hits it lands, never as a count on the step.
- **A rotation may fix its own window** (`fixedWindowSec`): the run then lasts
  exactly that long, and DPS divides by it. Casts shorter than the window are
  followed by idle time in which every status keeps its own schedule — a
  damage-over-time effect still up keeps ticking and still counts. A cast that
  runs past the window keeps only the hits inside it, for damage and for the
  triggers and status writes those hits make alike; nothing outside the window
  fires, scores or opens a window. The cast length is still reported beside the
  run length, and a rotation with no window is exactly as long as its casts.
- **A DoT row is named by its debuff, and only by its debuff** — never by the
  skill supplying the tick's coefficients. Absent or blank it falls back to the
  debuff's own `name`. **No marker is appended either way**, so a DoT and the
  cast that applies it report as one row whenever they carry the same name.
- ⚠️ **Three fields name this relationship, and the directions differ.** A
  hit's `triggers` is **outgoing** — what this hit sets off — and is persisted
  user data. A skill's or debuff's `triggersBuffs` is also **outgoing** — the
  buff ids a cast, or every tick of a debuff's `dot`, sets off. A skill's or
  debuff's `receives` is **incoming** — the buff ids that reach it. A buff
  module itself declares neither: it is a policy (`requires`, always-active,
  cooldown, rate limits) and a magnitude, addressed only by the id the skill or
  debuff names.

## Triggers

A trigger names a kind, a target id, a stack delta and optional conditions.
Rules:

- Negative stacks **consume**.
- Conditions are ANDed; a trigger fires only when all of them hold.
- Every condition clause is **window-aware**: it reads 0 stacks when the target
  status has no active window at that frame, even when its stack history holds a
  nonzero value from before it expired. DoT stack accrual deliberately reads the
  raw, non-window-aware count instead, because a DoT's live stacks must persist
  independently of any other status's window. Do not unify the two.
- Ordering matters: a trigger that applies the very status gating it must be
  applied **last**, or it gates itself.
- A trigger that enqueues another skill's hits must not form an unbounded chain.
- Extending an already-active window is a distinct operation from opening a
  fresh one. Do not emulate one with the other.
- A status the player only gains once the granting cast is over opens at that
  cast's end, declared on the trigger. Never emulate it by moving the trigger to
  a later hit: a hit's frame is where it lands, not where a window starts, and a
  cast's end is usually past every hit it has.
- **A trigger may open its own grant at a length other than the target
  status's own** (`durationFrames`): that grant's window uses it in place of
  the status's declared duration, for that grant alone.
- **A trigger may move one status's stacks onto another** (`transferFrom`): the
  target gains as many stacks as the source holds at that frame, window-aware
  and clamped to the target's cap, and the source is set to 0 at the same frame
  with its windows untouched. Such a trigger ignores its own stack delta and
  never extends; the target write fires the cap payout like any other write,
  and both passes resolve it against the same ledger state.
- **A trigger may be bound to a Qi phase** (`phase`): it fires only when the
  clock-driven phase at its frame — the rotation's Qi-break window and its
  low-Qi lead, never a status — is the named one. A stagger or control state
  the source material gates on is expressed as the `exhausted` phase.
- **A trigger may carry its own cooldown** (`cooldownFrames`): once it fires,
  the same trigger fires again only after that many frames. The first firing
  is never held back, a firing blocked by its conditions or phase does not
  start the cooldown, and every pass counts on its own, so the layout pass
  and the event loop agree.
- **A trigger may release a debuff's echo** (`releaseEcho`): everything the
  target debuff has banked since its last release is dealt at that hit's frame
  as one event on the echo's own row. It carries no share and no name — both
  live on the debuff — and an empty pot deals nothing. A re-application
  without it refreshes the mark and keeps banking; a pot no trigger releases
  is dealt when the debuff's coverage lapses, and never after the rotation
  ends.

**Linking to a stacking DoT is logic-free.** The kinds that add a stack and that
flag a detonation carry no thresholds of their own: the max stacks, the shared
duration, and the detonation rule (which skill, how many stacks retained, at
what build tier) live entirely on the target debuff. Never re-author any of it on
the trigger. A detonation flag without a sibling application on the same hit is
inert by design.

## Buffs and debuffs — two systems

Both end as `{statKey, amount}` effects. BUFFS.md decides which you want; these
are the authoring rules for each.

### The editor system — buffs, debuffs and hit triggers

Data-driven and user-authorable, injected at the app boundary and **never read
from storage inside the engine**, so locked fixtures stay byte-exact.

- A buff helps the player and applies onto the same `Inputs` fields the panel
  uses. A debuff is enemy-facing: target-scope reductions and/or a DoT.
- **A buff with no stat effects is legitimate.** A pure state marker that a hit
  variant or a trigger condition reads must still exist as a real buff, so it is
  visible in the Skill Editor and tracked on the cast timeline — never a bare
  engine constant.
- **A state marker that only exists for some builds declares `requiresParam`.**
  The timeline drops the buff entirely when that param is off, so a condition on
  it never holds and the state cannot be reached. Use it instead of gating each
  trigger site; the requirement belongs on the entity, once.
- **A state marker that only exists from some tier of that param declares
  `requiresMinTier`** next to `requiresParam`, and is dropped below that tier
  exactly as it is when the param is off. It is invalid without `requiresParam`.
- **A buff a rotation may open the fight already holding some of can declare
  its own starting count**, read only when the rotation carries no explicit
  opening entry of its own. Never written back into stored rotation data — a
  rotation saved before the counter existed still opens on the declared
  default, not on zero.
- **A timed buff may clear or reset another status when it lapses**
  (`onExpire`): at the frame a window ends with no other window of the same
  buff covering that frame, the target's stack count is set to the declared
  value. A refresh never fires it, an extension moves the frame it fires at,
  a permanent-activation buff never fires it, and each window fires at most
  once. The reset lands in the layout pass and the event loop alike, so a hit
  variant or cast length gated on the target sees it from that frame on. It
  may also declare `requiresBuffId`: the reset only lands if that other
  status has a live window at the same frame, so the same lapse silently
  does nothing without it.
- **A buff may count damaging hits** (`stacksPerDamagingHit`): every damaging
  hit from any skill grants one stack, at most once per its cooldown, clamped
  to `maxStacks` and opening the buff's own window. The granting hit's own
  triggers run after the grant.
- **A buff may fire triggers on reaching its cap** (`onMaxStacks`): the stack
  write that takes it from below `maxStacks` to `maxStacks` runs the listed
  `applyBuff`/`applyDebuff` triggers at that frame, conditions and
  extensions honoured, other trigger kinds ignored. A trigger fired this way
  never fires another buff's `onMaxStacks`, and may lower the firing buff
  itself.
- **A debuff may bank an echo** (`echo`): while one of its windows is active,
  every scored damage event a def feeds into it — a regular hit, a DoT tick or
  a mechanic's extra event — banks `share` of its realised damage. A release
  deals the banked sum as it stands: never re-run through the formula, never
  rolled, reported under the echo's own `breakdownName` and `skillType`, and
  only from events inside the rotation window. The echo may also declare a
  release-time adjustment: a factor applied once to the released total, read
  against the target's state at the release frame rather than at banking
  time.
- A class may ship built-in buffs alongside the user's own. A same-id user buff
  wins.
- **A status may carry a `description`**: one line of display text the cast
  chip shows under the name, rendered through the locale catalogue like every
  other name. Nothing matches on it, and it is never a substitute for an
  effect a module should author.
- **A DoT is authored on a debuff's `dot`, and nowhere else.** A `sustain`
  skill type is a scaling tag on one hit, not a DoT. Each tick runs through the
  kernel like any hit.
- A stacking DoT's detonation spec is the single source of truth for its
  threshold behaviour — see Triggers above.

### The class-buff system — buff modules

Id-referenced, not tag-matched. A module declares its **activation policy**
(always-active, or gated by `requires`, a cooldown, a rate limit) and its
**magnitude** as effects. Who applies it and who it boosts are declared by the
skill or debuff that owns that direction — `triggersBuffs` for applying,
`receives` for boosting — never by the module itself.

- A debuff's `triggersBuffs` fires on every tick of its `dot`, not once per
  window — the module's own policy (`cooldown`, a rate limit, `triggerPhase`,
  `requiresActiveBuffOnTrigger`, `requires`) gates a tick exactly as it gates a
  cast, so a def that should fire once per application still needs that gate
  authored on the module, not assumed from the trigger site.
- **A buff a debuff's tick applies reaches every damage event that comes after
  it in time** — a later tick of the same or a different debuff, a mechanic's
  own extra event, the chips of any cast resolving after it, and a regular hit
  too, since every damage event is scored in one time-ordered pass.
- **An `echo` effect is a feed, not a magnitude.** A def returning one names
  the debuff whose echo the event it reaches feeds; it changes nothing about
  the event itself. The share, the row and any release-time adjustment are
  the debuff's — never author them on the def.
- A def a class reaches purely by being that class goes on the class. A def an
  inner way gates goes on that inner way. A def that applies across every class,
  or is gated on a global toggle, goes on the global or group list. Getting this
  wrong changes which Skill Editor section the row appears in, not just where
  the file lives.
- Where a def's effects cannot be read without executing them, it must carry an
  author-written summary — the catalog and the display gates read the
  declarative fields without running anything.
- **One id declared as both a ledger gate and a module is one entity in two
  projections.** The gate side carries no effects, so a cast chip takes its
  effects from the module side; only the module may author a magnitude, and the
  gate's `requiresParam` must match the module's own requirement or the state
  opens for a build the module never reaches.
- **A module's `effects` may read the build's min physical attack from its
  context, alongside the fight state.** It is the same value the damage kernel
  takes as base min phys, and a magnitude that scales with it is computed in
  the module — never re-derived in the UI or hardcoded in the timeline.
- **A module's `effects` may read the target's remaining health from
  context**, as a fraction of its max that falls with the damage dealt so far
  in time order — never re-derived from a hit count or a display value.
- **A module's `effects` may read the build's breakthrough from its
  context**, the same way it reads min physical attack. A module that only
  exists from some breakthrough on declares that minimum in `requires` rather
  than returning no effects below it — the catalog and the display gates read
  `requires` without executing anything, so a gate hidden inside `effects`
  never reaches them.

## Procedural behaviour

A skill with genuinely procedural behaviour registers a **factory** against its
id rather than being special-cased in the loop. Factories, not instances — state
such as a charge counter must not carry between simulations. A per-hit art patch
is the **only** sanctioned art-level adjustment, and it comes from a behaviour or
a mechanic, never from a branch in the loop.

The status ledger and the buff engine are **two stores on purpose**: the ledger
calls a status active if any recorded window covers the frame, the engine goes by
the latest apply at or before it, so a shorter re-apply _shortens_ the buff.
Writing the engine's applies into the ledger would silently extend every buff
shaped that way. Merging them needs a per-status policy — a design decision, not
a refactor.

## Checklist

- Declare resource capacity, launch identity, upkeep and gain rules on the owning
  class definition; keep resource names and values out of the engine.
- Gate resource-controlled ticks before their damage or buff triggers. A depleted
  launch must not revive from later refunds. Each new launch starts its own cadence.
- Distribute declared whole-skill resource gains over authored hits; credit only
  executed damaging hits, and keep once-per-cast bonuses independent.
- Gate conditional additional pulse impacts at execution time, so status extensions
  from earlier accepted impacts can affect later impacts.
- Apply phase-dependent hit refunds only at accepted hit times; elapsed time alone
  must not grant a hit refund. Clamp balances and use the encounter's phase clock.
- Expose uncertain gain amounts as persisted, hydrated inputs. Report actual funded
  windows and rejected launches, and distinguish assumptions from measured anchors.

1. English identifiers only.
2. Coefficients, frames and `castFrames` set per hit.
3. `skillType` correct — it selects the boost bucket and the sustain branch.
4. `elevatedAttributeMultiplier` left at its default unless the hit has its
   own reason to demote.
5. DoTs on a debuff's `dot`, never faked with a `sustain` hit.
6. Giving a status: a hit trigger (editor system) or a `requires`-gated
   module, applied by the skill's own `triggersBuffs`, or by every tick of a
   debuff's `dot` via the debuff's own `triggersBuffs` (class-buff system).
   Links to a stacking DoT stay logic-free.
7. Receiving: the skill or debuff lists the buff's id in its own `receives`.
8. **No invisible magic** — the effect is a data-driven def visible in the Skill
   Editor. Extend the schema rather than branching in the timeline.
9. Verify: locked fixtures stay bit-exact, and add or extend a test. The
   calculation rules have no cached anchor, so reason about them explicitly.
