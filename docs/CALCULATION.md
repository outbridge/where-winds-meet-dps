# CALCULATION.md — rules for the damage math

Rules an implementation of the damage math must satisfy. It does not describe
what `formula.ts`, `panel.ts` or `derivedInputs.ts` do — read those. Skill,
buff and mechanic specifics belong in the module that defines them, never here
(CLAUDE.md § "Docs are implementation rules").

## One kernel

There is one damage kernel and one calculation mode. Every buff, debuff,
mechanic and scoped stat lands as `{statKey, amount}` effects summed onto
`Inputs` or the target override, from which the formula context is built. **A
buff never does its own math**, and nothing computes damage outside the kernel.

## The stat layer

Everything here runs **before** any damage math and produces the `Inputs` the
kernel consumes. Category-1 base-stat buffs belong here (BUFFS.md).

- A saved profile holds **no resolved stat fields**. They are recomputed on
  every load, so never persist a derived stat.
- Bumping a base-stat configuration means editing the level row **and** the
  summation that consumes it. Adding a row field alone changes nothing.
- The base-stat row and the runtime level bonus must read the **same** level
  constant. Two sources drift silently.
- A per-point attribute conversion is authored **once**, and every consumer
  imports it. A gear-word delta is derived from the word's roll and that table —
  a pre-multiplied literal is a second copy of the max roll, and goes stale the
  moment either moves.
- A selection is stored; the bonus it implies is added during the derive. Never
  store a bonus that a selection already implies.
- **The food bonus is not a stat-layer add.** It is applied inside the kernel at
  the min/max-phys step, and that is its only application site. Applying it in
  the stat layer double-counts it.

## White vs yellow rates

Read **CLAUDE.md § "White vs Yellow rates — DO NOT FLIP THIS"** before touching
anything rate-shaped. Two rules bind here:

1. White → yellow conversion happens in **exactly one place**, and yellow is
   what the kernel consumes. Do not convert anywhere else.
2. Direct rates are unaffected by resistance — the same value white or yellow.

## The formula chain

- The single-letter variable names are inherited from the spreadsheet the
  formula was reverse-engineered from. They carry **no meaning** beyond that:
  treat them as opaque, not as a claim about any live data source.
- Two kernel parameters are vestigial on the live path — the per-call hit count
  is always 1, and the counters are always zero. Do not build a mechanic that
  depends on either; the qi phase reaches the kernel through buff effects and
  per-hit art patches instead.
- **A target-side reduction subtracts inside the bracket it opposes; it is never
  an addend in the additive boost total.** A whole-damage reduction is its own
  factor in the shared tail every row passes through, so it reaches a
  damage-over-time tick and an ordinary hit alike. A damage-boost bracket is
  floored at zero after the subtraction, and a crit- or affinity-damage
  reduction applies **before** that multiplier's clamp, so it is clamped with
  everything else.
- **An independent damage boost is its own multiplicative factor in the shared
  tail every row passes through, never an addend in the additive boost
  total.**

## Calculation rules

Three corrections apply **unconditionally**, from the external sources below.
They have no cached anchor — `tests/engine/damageRules.test.ts` is the only
guard, and it is directional.

1. **Graze/abrasion rate** is `(1 − precision) × (1 − affinity)`, not
   `1 − precision` (PDF §8). Differs only below 100 % precision. An
   abrasion-avoid fraction scales this rate down further, and the mass it
   removes lands on the normal row, never on crit.
2. **Penetration** uses net `(pen − resistance)`, `÷100` when net ≤ 0 (deficit
   at full weight) and `÷200` when net > 0 (overflow halved), for the physical
   and every attribute track. ⚠️ This **corrects PDF §7** — the CN sources'
   worked examples go the other way, and the PDF-literal branch inflated the
   pen term about 2×. **Do not "fix" it back.**
3. **A skill's own rate bonus** — crit and affinity alike — is added undivided
   onto the already-resisted panel rate, floored at zero, and falls **inside**
   the cap (PDF §11). The direct rate is added **after** the cap, unaffected by
   resistance.

**The martial art's attribute multiplier applies to every row alike, its flat
term together with its coefficient** — a damage-over-time tick included.
Nothing demotes a row to the non-matching coefficient by default;
`elevatedAttributeMultiplier` still exists per row and defaults true, for a
data module that has a genuine reason to set it false — and a row that does
demotes both terms together, never one without the other.

**Penetration resistance is zero for every target below breakthrough 20, and
non-zero from breakthrough 20 on.** It is read off the target's own
breakthrough, the same way its defense is.

**A per-hit bonus that scales a row's flat terms scales the physical and
attribute flat term alike, and applies before the martial art's
attribute-flat multiplier** so the two compose multiplicatively in that
order. It never reaches either coefficient term.

### Sources of truth

These external sources are authoritative. On conflicts **between** sources,
prefer corroboration (two agreeing beat one) and worked numeric examples over
prose.

Midasione.pdf`. Primary reference (§1 base damage, §8 hit outcomes, §11 rate
   resistances, §12 attribute conversions). Known error: §7's pen branches are
   inverted — see rule 2.

## Inner-way layers — classify before implementing

An inner way can reshape the calculation in three places. The buckets are
**disjoint**: classify a new effect first, and never let one effect land in two.

1. **Flat tier stats** — the module's own always-on and per-tier `panelStats`,
   folded in during the derive. Always-on stat adds, invisible to the Skill
   Editor. Tiers that are individually selectable carry their stats on the tier
   rather than unconditionally. A tier stat that moves with the character
   breakthrough is a `ladder`, resolved against the build's breakthrough at
   derive time; a breakthrough outside the ladder takes its nearest row.
2. **Context scalars** — the module's `scalars` block, summed across slotted
   inner ways. `minTier` gates the whole block. No engine file may name an inner
   way to read one.
3. **The buff engine** — a `BuffModule` gated by `requires.param`, enabled from
   the build through the module's own `buffParam`. A _conditional, triggered_
   inner-way mechanic belongs here (CLAUDE.md § "Buffs").

An inner way commonly spans more than one bucket. That is fine; counting one
effect twice is not.

⚠️ **A buff-def gated on an inner-way param must not restate a stat that inner
way's `panelStats` already bakes in.** Mapping a `buffParam` whose defs
duplicate a mechanic's own model is a double-count, and the engine will not
warn. When a mechanic and a def model the same thing, one of them contributes —
decide which, and leave the param unmapped if that is the answer.

## Mechanic rules

A mechanic is the escape hatch for what the def schema cannot express — a
stochastic per-hit roll, a stacking-and-decaying reduction, a stateful counter.

- **Declared by the thing it is a mechanic of** — its class, its inner way, its
  gear set, its consumable. `src/engine/mechanics/` holds only the contract and
  the registry: **no instances**.
- **Registry order is load-bearing.** Contributions apply in it and float
  addition is not associative. The memo signature is derived from what a
  mechanic returns, never hand-appended.
- **A stochastic effect is a seeded whole-rotation schedule**, not a buff def —
  a def cannot express a per-hit roll. Say so in the module when you add one. It
  must **accept the run's generator when the engine supplies one** and realise a
  single trajectory instead of averaging its own fixed-seed sweep; without one it
  averages as before. A schedule that ignores the generator keeps reporting an
  expectation on a run that has none, and understates the spread.
- **Only hits laid by the rotation roll a proc.** DoT ticks and
  trigger-enqueued hits do not. This is structural; do not work around it per
  mechanic.
- **A target-resistance reduction is modelled as player penetration.** Target
  pen resistance is zero and there is no target-resistance stat key, so the two
  are numerically identical.
- **A DoT ticks on one continuous grid per episode** of continuously-maintained
  application, so a debuff re-applied faster than its tick interval keeps a
  steady cadence. **Do not reintroduce a per-window phase reset** — a
  re-application must not restart the phase.
- **A party-applied debuff and an inner way modelling the same effect must not
  both contribute.** Suppress the stat contribution while the shared one is
  active; DoT damage is not suppressed.
