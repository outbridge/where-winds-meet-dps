# MIGRATIONS.md — healing saved profiles

How to write a localStorage migration, and how the version chain behaves.
**Whether you need one** is CLAUDE.md § "localStorage migrations" — that check runs
on every change and is not optional. How to test one is TESTING.md § "Migration
tests".

Saved profiles are the one part of this app that cannot be regenerated. A user's
gear inventory, panel stats and rotation exist nowhere else. Every rule here
follows from that.

## Where user data lives

Saved profiles (inputs plus gear inventory), Skill Editor copies of skills and of
debuffs, user-authored rotations and buffs, and a legacy single-build blob that is
rolled into a default profile on first load. Profiles, skill copies and debuff
copies each walk their own migration chain (`src/migrations/`,
`src/migrations/customSkills/`, `src/migrations/customDebuffs/`); the rest carry a
version constant and heal through their hydrators.

## What counts as "affects saved profiles"

Much wider than adding a field. Any of these needs a migration:

- A field **added to or removed from** any persisted shape — the classic additive
  case.
- A field **renamed**, or its unit, meaning or valid range changed.
- **A data allowlist narrowed** — trimming the inner ways, gear words, sets,
  arsenals, tags, rotations or talents a class may use. A stored profile can still
  hold the removed value and keep scoring it while the UI no longer offers it: an
  invisible, wrong contribution.
- **A new invariant enforced only in the UI.** The control enforces it going
  forward; a profile saved before it still violates it. Enforce it in the hydrator
  too, or it is not an invariant.
- **A default changed** in a way stored blobs should follow.
- **An id scheme changed** — repair the value, and repair it in **both** places when
  a store has no version chain of its own: a versioned step for the chained store,
  and the same pure function called unconditionally in the hydrator for the one
  without.
- **A field became derived** — it must stop being persisted, and any stored blob
  still carrying it needs the stale copy stripped.

## Two kinds of change — pick the right one

**1. Additive, with a sensible default.** Extend the relevant hydrate helper to
inject the default. **Do not bump the version.** Existing blobs keep working, and
the hydrator must be idempotent because it runs on every load.

For a rotation field, add the hydrate pass **before** the validation filter —
otherwise a rotation missing the new field is silently dropped instead of healed.

**2. Incompatible** — renaming a field, changing a unit, removing a load-bearing
field. For the two version-counter stores, bump the constant and add a line to the
version-history block; older blobs are dropped and the user falls back to defaults.
**Do not** try to silently auto-convert across an incompatible shape change there —
better to lose stale data than to corrupt it.

**For saved profiles there is no dropping.** That version is derived from the
migration registry, so add a step instead.

**Rule of thumb:** if a single-line default makes existing blobs behave correctly
under the new code, it is additive. Otherwise it is incompatible. **Prefer
additive** — a version bump throws away the user's gear inventory.

## The profile chain

A stored profiles blob carries a version and is walked **up one version at a
time** until it reaches the latest, then hydrated and re-saved at the new version
so the walk happens once rather than on every load. The latest version is
**derived from the registry**, never written by hand.

### Rule 1 — a profile is never deleted

Not for being too old, too new, unversioned, corrupt, or for tripping a bug in a
migration:

| situation                       | behaviour                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| no step registered for a hop    | stepped over, blob kept                              |
| a step throws                   | caught; the pre-step blob carries forward            |
| version missing or not a number | treated as `0`, walked from the bottom               |
| version **newer** than we know  | returned untouched — a downgrade must not shred data |
| the store is not an array       | preserved as-is for the caller to salvage            |

The only paths that fall back to a fresh default are "nothing stored" and "the JSON
does not parse" — cases with nothing to recover. Hydration runs after the chain and
fills defaults for anything a step left unreadable, **so a step never has to delete
a field to make it safe**.

### Rule 2 — one hop per file

`V<n>__<whatItDoes>.ts`, exporting a migration whose target is `<n>`, migrating a
blob at `n - 1` to `n` and **nothing else**. Register it in the chain array; order
and the name/target match are asserted.

### Rule 3 — steps are pure and idempotent

Return a new blob; never mutate the input. Running a step twice must equal running
it once, because the chain is not the only caller — imported profiles and the
legacy blob reach the same transforms through the hydrator.

**Prefer carrying a value to its new home before dropping the old key** rather than
deleting and re-defaulting.

### Rule 4 — every step ships with a test against a real captured profile

TESTING.md § "Migration tests" is the required shape.

### Rule 5 — captured profiles are filed by version, one per class

`tests/migrations/testProfiles/v<version>/<classId>.json`. The filename is the
class the profile **resolves to**, which is not always the id it stores — an id a
later step renames still files under its migrated name.

A skill or debuff store is captured whole:
`tests/migrations/testCustomSkills/v<version>/store.json` and
`tests/migrations/testCustomDebuffs/v<version>/store.json`, one folder per version
from the chain's floor to the version before the latest, each holding an untouched
seeded copy, an edited copy and a user-authored entry so a step proves it rewrites
only the first. Mechanically enforced by `tests/migrations/testCustomStoreFolders.test.ts`.

Adding a step means adding the folder it reads from: every registered class needs
a profile at the newest stored version, and a class present at one version must be
present at every later one. Where no real capture exists, walk the nearest earlier
profile forward through the chain. Mechanically enforced by
`tests/migrations/testProfileFolders.test.ts`.

### Scope

Three stores walk a chain — saved profiles, skill copies and debuff copies — and
every rule above binds each of them: one hop per file under the store's own folder,
pure and idempotent steps, a captured fixture per step, and a walk that never
deletes. A skill or debuff store older than its chain's floor is the one exception:
its shape predates the chain and it is dropped, as it was before. Coefficient
repairs on a stored copy are steps, never hydrator code; the hydrator keeps only
what has to run on every load because it depends on the current built-in library
(tags, reach) or on an import. Rotations and buffs carry a version constant, heal
through their hydrators, reuse the transforms a step exports, and still drop on
version mismatch.

## Every migration must be

- **Idempotent** — it runs on every load.
- **Non-throwing** — a corrupt or unrecognised value degrades (skip that slot, fall
  back to a default) and never breaks the whole load. Beware lookups that **throw**
  on an unknown id; hydration-path code must use a tolerant one.
- **Tested** — TESTING.md § "Migration tests".
- **Conservative about deleting** — clear the one field that is now illegal; do not
  discard neighbouring user data to be safe.
- **Silent about what it cannot resolve** — a stored value this build does not
  recognise is kept exactly as written, and scores nothing. Repair renames and
  clamps; it never empties a field to make an unknown value go away. A profile
  written by a newer build and opened by an older one is the ordinary case, and
  there every unrecognised value is one the user still owns. The one thing that
  is still cleared is a value this build **does** define but the current
  selection forbids: that one would be scored, and a build the selection cannot
  hold is the invisible wrong number an allowlist exists to stop.
- **Checked against the default build** — the hydrator runs on the default profile,
  so a too-aggressive migration can silently change the app's default build.

Tests do not catch a _missing_ migration. The symptom is a user opening a stale
localStorage and seeing crashes or silently wrong numbers. That is why the
CLAUDE.md check is on you, every time.
