# CLASSES.md — classes, content layout, and id schemes

Rules for adding or editing a class, a skill/buff/debuff module, or anything that
mints an entity id.

## Implemented classes

A class is **registered** once it appears in the class barrel: its data is live
and the app runs it. A class is **validated** only once its output is pinned
against a measured build. `ClassDef.validated` states which, and the two are
independent — register a class the moment its data is authored, flip `validated`
only when an anchor test defends its numbers.

**Registration alone makes a class selectable.** Every class the barrel carries is
offered in the class picker; `validated` gates how far its numbers may be trusted,
never whether the UI shows it.

**Bellstrike Umbra (`bellstrikeUmbra`, spec `bellstrike_umbra`), Bellstrike
Splendor (`bellstrikeSplendor`, spec `bellstrike_splendor`), Stonesplit
Strength (`stonesplitStrength`, spec `stonesplit_strength`) and Bamboocut
Draught (`bamboocutDraught`, spec `bamboocut_draught`) are validated** — each
holds a measured build exactly. Rely on nothing any of them reports beyond what
its anchor pins.

**Silkbind Jade (`silkbindJade`, spec `silkbind_jade`) is registered and not
validated** — selectable, and carrying nothing an anchor defends.

The remaining classes — the other Stonesplit and Bamboocut specs — are **not
registered**. Their imported data lives under `reference/classes/`, unimported
by the app and the tests. Treat everything there as provisional.

Two of them **share one spec** as a stand-in. That is not a claim they play
alike, and it is why a trigger authored for one can silently target a skill
another never received.

**Registering one of them is data work, not engine work**: sourcing and verifying
its numbers. The extension points are already proven from outside the engine.
Test-suite consequences are in TESTING.md § "Class scoping".

## Where content lives

`src/data/` holds **only content** — value declarations, id tables, JSON tables.
`src/definitions/` holds the contracts, registries and composition.

- **Adding a class touches only `src/data/`** — its own folder in the class tree,
  its skill folder, plus a one-line entry in the class barrel. Never
  `src/definitions/`, never `src/engine/`.
- **A class's own modules live in one folder per class**, whose barrel exports the
  `defineClass` call. A module only one class uses belongs there, not beside the
  barrel.
- **A mystic art lives in the shared mystic folder**, never in a class folder —
  § "Mystic arts".
- **Every entity is authored through a `define*` factory** from
  `src/definitions/` — skills, debuffs, gate buffs, buff modules, sets, inner
  ways, martial arts, rotations, graduation builds, classes. There is no JSON
  authoring format, and `src/data/` carries no JSON at all — a lookup table is a
  module whose rows go through a `define*` factory like any other entity.
- **A built-in rotation is one module in its class folder's rotations folder**,
  default-exporting its `defineRotation` call. Its class id is its only
  registration: never list a rotation in a barrel.
- **A graduation build is one module in its class folder's graduation builds
  folder**, default-exporting its `defineGraduationBuild` call, and carries a
  name. Its class id is its only registration, and its id is what a profile
  stores: renaming the id is a storage change, renaming the name never is.
- Nothing under `src/data/` may declare a `define*` contract or call a
  `register*` entry point.
- Nothing under `src/definitions/` may reach past a `src/data/` folder barrel or
  an `ids.ts` into an individual content module.
- Both halves are mechanically guarded (TESTING.md § "The architecture guards").

Naming: per-class folders are kebab-case in both the class and the skill tree,
as are the skill files inside one. Every other module and table under `src/data/`
is camelCase.

## One definition per class

One accessor answers what a class is made of — spec, primary attribute, inner
ways, class-specific attunement ids, skills, debuffs, buffs, rotations and
default, graduation builds, attunements, retunement pool. **Reach for it rather
than the individual registries.**

**A profile follows one graduation build, and the graduation rate simulates both
sides on that build's rotation** — the user's build and the benchmark alike,
never the rotation the user has selected — so it compares gear, not rotation
choice.

**A build may also fix the encounter both sides are simulated in** — every
encounter setting, plus the slotted inner ways and their tiers. A setting the
build does not name is off, the profile's own selection is ignored on both sides
of the rate, and every number outside the rate keeps following that selection.
The break window is the one setting a build cannot fix: it stays the rotation's
own. A build that fixes nothing rates the profile exactly as it is set.

- A class with a single graduation build follows it without a choice, and a
  loaded profile stores it.
- A class with several follows none until the profile picks one; while none is
  followed there is no rate, and the app asks for one rather than leaving the
  choice to be discovered.
- A class change clears the pick. A stored id naming another class's build is
  cleared on load; an id this build does not know is kept as stored.

**A profile may follow a build the user authored instead of a shipped one.** It
lives in its own store and never in the profile blob, reaching the engine the
way every other user-authored entity does: injected at the boundary and filtered
by class. Only its stat lines and attunements are chosen — every value is the
maximum for the gear level, as a benchmark's is. A class carries at most one,
and it stands beside the shipped builds everywhere those are listed.

**A gear piece is an heirloom when its five stat lines are the ones some
graduation build's piece for that slot carries** — any build of the class, in
any order, whatever the rolled values, rarity, level or relayed state. A piece
one line short is heirloom-ready only while that one retune is still legal, and
the retunement advisor ranks that swap above its best-DPS swap. On a piece that
already matches, the advisor withholds its best-DPS recommendation altogether:
a swap that ends the match is never advised, whatever it would gain.

**An equipped piece carries the heirloom treatment only for the build the
profile follows**, an unequipped one for any build of the class. A match against
a build the profile does not follow is still a match — it is named as such
rather than dropped.

**Nothing in `src/engine` may name a class, an inner way or a skill**, compare a
display name against a literal, or match a cast tag by prefix. The starting build
is allowlisted as content rather than logic.

Whatever a class does beyond data reaches the engine through registrations
declared as fields on its own definition, which one registry loop reads:

| the class needs                          | it declares            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| state markers the timeline reads         | gate buffs             |
| a counter the rotation editor opens with | opening-stack buff ids |
| a stochastic or stateful mechanic        | mechanics              |
| procedural behaviour on one skill        | skill behaviours       |
| a Skill Editor "is this active" gate     | display gates          |
| a poison/DoT extension window            | poison extensions      |

An inner way, a gear set or a consumable declares mechanics the same way, read
by its own registry. `declareMechanic` is the one contract every owner uses,
and it carries no ordering: a mechanic's contributions must not depend on
which other mechanics ran first.

An inner way may also declare gate buffs, display gates, buff-defs and skill
behaviours of its own, for what it — not any one class — owns. Two of those need a
per-class composition step and two do not:

- **Gate buffs and buff-defs are folded into every class that can slot the inner
  way**, because every consumer asks for a class's gates and the buff engine is
  constructed per class.
- **Display gates and skill behaviours register directly**, because both are
  global id-keyed bindings with no owner concept.

**An inner way may name a class-owned skill id.** Once a mechanic is a full
inner-way entity, leaving the one line that says what advances it on the class
would split one entity across two owners. Persisted ids already contain a class
id, so this crosses no new line.

## Buff ownership

> **A class buff is a weapon-art talent, and nothing else.** The talents on a
> weapon's Martial Arts Talents panel — the ones granting stat scaling and a
> handful of always-on effects — are the class's own list. Every other buff is a
> **normal buff**, even one only this class can ever produce.

- A **weapon-art talent** goes on the class's own list.
- A buff a **skill triggers** is a normal buff and goes on the global list. Being
  reachable by one class only does **not** make it a class buff — what decides is
  whether a skill triggers it or the talent panel grants it. A normal buff only
  one class can produce declares that class in `requires.classId`, so it exists
  in no other class's build; when always active, the rotation editor suppresses
  its chip for that class exactly as it does the class's own.
- A def an **inner way gates** goes on that inner way.
- A def gated on a global toggle goes on the global or group list.

This is not a filing convenience: the class's own list is what puts a row in the
Skill Editor's spec-mechanics section instead of the general buff list, and what
the rotation editor's chip suppression narrows further. A skill-triggered buff
filed on the class therefore shows up as a spec mechanic, which is wrong — it is
a buff the skill applies, not a property of the class. The class or inner way
that lists a module is the **only** statement of its scope; the marker on the
module itself is inert everywhere else.

## Mystic arts — one source, shared by every class

A mystic art belongs to no class. It is authored **once** in the shared mystic
folder, with `mystic` as its class id and its id segment, and every class's
composed definition carries it and the debuffs it applies exactly as authored —
nothing is instantiated, stamped or copied.

- **A `mystic`-typed skill never lives in a class folder**, and a class never
  re-declares a debuff a mystic art applies.
- A mystic art and its debuffs carry no attribute path of their own: a
  non-`weapon` hit elevates the casting class's primary attribute, so the same
  module is right for every class.
- Nothing a mystic art or its debuff references may name a class.
- An entity whose class id is the shared one belongs to **every** class. A user
  copy is filtered by `belongsToClass`, never by class-id equality, and a copy
  seeded from a mystic art keeps the shared class id.
- Mechanically guarded (TESTING.md § "The architecture guards").

## Universal skills — one source, instantiated per class

A class-neutral skill that is not a mystic art lives **once**, with `universal`
as its id segment, and is instantiated per class: the `universal` segment in the
skill id, and in every id a trigger's target or a condition's buff names,
becomes the class id, and the attribute path becomes the instantiating class's
primary attribute.

- **Never duplicate a universal skill into a class folder.**
- The instantiated `<classId>-<slug>` id shape is **load-bearing** — saved
  rotations and user overrides match built-ins by id, so a universal skill must
  never surface with a class-less id.

## Id schemes

- **Class ids are English camelCase.** Never pinyin. Spec ids keep snake_case —
  a different namespace.
- **Entity ids carry no vendor namespace**: skills are `<classId>-<slug>`, buffs
  `buff-<classId>-<slug>`, debuffs `debuff-<classId>-<slug>`. A mystic art and
  the debuffs it applies take `mystic` as the class segment.
- The `buff-` / `debuff-` prefixes are **load-bearing** — a DoT's tick-skill id
  is derived by stripping the debuff prefix when the debuff names none.
  Authoring the source skill id explicitly overrides that.
- **Both id schemes are user data.** Repair functions heal old blobs on every
  load and must stay idempotent (MIGRATIONS.md).
- A comment may cite the reference site as the **source** of a ported value. That
  is provenance, not naming.

## Naming a new domain term

Look the Chinese up in the official pair list (docs/REFERENCE-DATA.md) and copy
the official English. **Never hand-invent a term the game already names.** The
no-Chinese-in-`src` rule is CLAUDE.md § "Language".
