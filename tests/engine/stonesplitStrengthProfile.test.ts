// The acceptance anchor for Stonesplit Strength: a captured build, asserted
// exactly. A change that moves either number has changed the engine's answer,
// not just its shape. Re-baselined for the Cleftpeak 4-piece correction: 5.1s
// (not 5), a stacking ×(1 + 1%/stack) ramp multiplied with a separate ×1.08 at
// five stacks (not a flat +5% always-on plus an additive +8% at max stacks).
// Re-baselined again, in the last floating-point place only: the engine now
// sums every damage event into the total in one time-ordered pass, which
// reorders the same floating-point additions.
// Re-baselined again: the Exhausted (Qi-break) bonus now multiplies outside
// the additive boost bracket instead of folding into it, raising every hit
// and tick inside the break window.
// Re-baselined again: the stored Fire Oil setting now also applies its Burn
// DoT, not just its flat damage bonus.
// Re-baselined again: the talent board follows the profile's breakthrough, and
// this build stands at 16, so the nodes behind Solo Mode Level 17 no longer
// count towards it.
