// The reference def carries these as ONE cast total spread over six hits, not
// as a per-hit value: every other multi-hit skill in the reference set — 31 of
// them across five specs — has a per-hit coefficient equal to its cast total
// divided by its hit count, and the ÷3 ones still carry the repeating decimal
// that proves it. This is the only multi-hit def whose value was left undivided,
// which is why its 1.7173 sits alongside SINGLE-hit skills (FanLightCharged
// 1.9039, UmbQ 2.3389) instead of below them.
//
// Kept as total ÷ hits rather than six decimals, so the number the reference
// actually states stays legible.
