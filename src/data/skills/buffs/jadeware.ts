// "Casting Martial Art Skill activates Jadeware effect: Increases Affinity DMG
// by 10% and increases Direct Affinity Rate by 7.5% against targets in Qi
// Imbalance or with a Qi percentage lower than yours or below 40%. This effect
// lasts 10s and can only trigger once every 12s." (in-game set tooltip, as of

//
// The tooltip reads as if both bonuses were gated on the target's Qi; the
// buff itself carries `affinityDamageBoost` unconditionally for the
// whole window, and only `directAffinityRate` asks about the target. Every
// low-Qi source the sim models — the lead-in window, Qi Imbalance, and the
// broken bar during qi-break — reports a non-`normal` phase.
